This was my first time working with pytorch. 

The AI model learns to complete a "Line". It learns patterns based on some sort of trial and error function called "loss". slowly changing its predictions untill it more resembles the true values

The blue dots are the values of the line. And is what the model is trained on

The green dots are what the ai model is sepossed to predict. The ai never "sees" the green dots. But should know what these are based on the blue dots

The red dots are the AIs prediction. you can see the AI does not put the dots exacly on the green dots. This is because the Learning rate is too high. 
But i kept it this way because i wanted to prove to myself that the computer is really not just taking the green dots values, Just for practising purposes
